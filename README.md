# Branching Manager

This repository holds code and an UML diagram for my project which i developed during work on OOD and OOP

  - THe UML Class structure Diagram
  - branch.py which holds a class basic for the program
  - main.py which holds the logic for interaction with the objects

To run download the files and run  in the console "main.py"

During work on the project i come to conclusion that using the UML Diagram which i created would violate best practices. I even considered using inheritance so every class would be a subclass of the higher class, But decided not go with it since some lower level class would inherit not appropiate methods. 

My solution to this problem was that i designed and written a class which had all the object logic within herself, and UI and moving through the project would be realised in other file
